Fogging of transparent surfaces, such as eyeglasses, vehicle windshields, bathroom mirrors,
and camera lenses, remains a persistent daily life problem. This issue is exacerbated in
humid environments, causing inconvenience, safety hazards, and reduced efficiency in
optical devices. Existing solutions, including anti-fog sprays, hydrophilic coatings, and
ventilation techniques, have limited effectiveness due to their short-lived performance and
environmental concerns. This paper proposes a novel approach using a self-regenerating
nanostructured anti-fog coating that utilizes photothermal and super-hydrophilic properties
to prevent condensation buildup. The methodology, material selection, and experimental
validation are discussed, along with the potential impact on industries and consumer
applications.
